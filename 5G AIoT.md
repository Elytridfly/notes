- biggest change in 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), aka Next Generation RAN or NG-RAN, architecture is the distributed concept
- gNodeB (5G base station) is split into gNodeB- Central Unit (CU) and gNodeB-Distributed Unit(DU)
- CU can be placed in cloud infrastructure
- CU and DU control data transmission and radio access
- lower-level RF processing and data plane processing are purview of DU
- higher-level operations and control plane signalling are handled by CU
- they interact with each other allowing for distributed radio access and centralised control
- gNodeB communicate with each other to improve network performance through coordination and optimisation


### Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
- responsible for managing access and mobility aspects of UE 
- terminates control plane interface from gNB

- when data is used to train the ML algorithm, the resulting output is actually the ML model
- a predictive algorithm will provide a predictive model
- a prediction based on data will be sent when model receives it
- ML is a combination of the following:

``` Data + Model -> Compute Prediction```

- model comprises of our expectation based on prior info, which can come from transfer learning or can just be out convictions/beliefs
- humans have biases built into our "models"
- the prediction can be a classification, a course of action, or a quality rating

- programs that learn and get better based on experience need ML due to the intricacy/complexity of the given situation and need for adaptation
- tasks that are highly complex like driving, picture recognition, speech recognition are not easy to code and need ML
- manually coded tools will limit its characteristic/features as it will stay the same once deployed and will not change despite the task varying over time
- ML trains programs to change how they behave in response to incoming data, allowing them to adapt 

- Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement 
- 3 most popular techniques in ML
- Supervised uses manually labeled data
- Unsupervised looks for patterns and structures in data automatically
- Reinforcement combines rewards or penalties with trail-and-error method

## Supervised Learning
![[Pasted image 20250517110719.png]]

- A data set with certain observations and labels of them is needed for supervised learning
- they can subsequently be used with observations that were not know previously
- when new unseen data is supplied, the algorithm generates an inference function to make predictions
- by comparing actual output with intended output, the model can further refine, aka "backwards propagation" of errors

- 2 main types of supervised models:
	- Classification : output variable is category
	- Regression : output variable is real continuous value

- examples:
	- Linear regression - mainly for regression problems
	- Random forest - mainly for classification and regression problems
	- Support vector machines - mainly for classification problems


## Unsupervised Learning
![[Pasted image 20250517111841.png]]

- learns patterns from unlabeled data
- finding patterns in data that were previously unknown

- typical application of Unsupervised Learning:
	- Clustering : auto split data set into groups according to similarity
	- Anomaly detection : used to auto discover unusual data points in dataset 
	- Association mining : used to identify sets of items that frequently occur together
	- Latent variable model: used for data pre-processing (reducing no. features in data set - dimensionality reduction)

## Reinforcement Learning
![[Pasted image 20250517114236.png]]

- Reinforcement Learning (RL) 3 common technique
- "Agent" learns to accomplish the objective/goals
- it will be rewarded or penalised for actions that it executes
- objective is to maximize agent's reward

- creation of appropriate simulation environment is 1 of the primary a challenges in RL
- to train autonomous driving algorithms, RL environment ned to accurately mimic scenarios like breaks and crashes
- advantage is that training model in simulated environment is typically less expensive than utilising immature models


## Machine Learning Cycle
![[Pasted image 20250517114545.png]]


## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning
![[Pasted image 20250517114623.png]]

- ANN are specialised field within ML
- loose inspiration for ANN comes from neural networks that make up the brain
- group of interconnected nodes called neurons serves as representation of ANN
- "edges" allude to connections like synapses in the human brain
- each edge can send messages to other neurons
- after processing incoming signals, receiving neuron notifies its associated neurons
- Signals are numbers, and statistical functions are used to compute them

- there is a weighted relationship between neurons and edges that either increase or decrease a signal strength 
- you can change the weights as you continue to learn
- neurons are typically grouped into layers with each layer altering the input in a different way
- these layers allow signals to pass through possibly several times 
- employment of numerous layers in these networks are indicated by adjective "deep" in the context of deep learning

![[Pasted image 20250517121249.png]]

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are popular way that ANN are implemented
- variation to multilayer perceptrons is used by CNN
- there are one or more convolutional layers in a CNN
- its possible for these layers to be pools or fully interlocked
- integral that quantifies the amount for 2 functions overlap as one passes over the other is called an convolution
- convolution is the process of multiplying 2 functions to combine them
- in convolutional layer, input operation is applied before passing to next layer
- convolutional procedure allows network to use less parameters but still be substantially deeper
- CNN perform incredibly well in systems for natural language processing and image and video recognition because of this ability

- **Convolution** : Extracting features from input image, preserving spatial relationship between pixel by using small squares of input data (linear operation : performs well elementwise in matrix multiplication and addition)

- **Non Linearity** : ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an operation applied after convolution operations. ReLU introduces Non-linearity in the CNN which is important as most real-world data is non-linear

- **Spatial Pooling/ down-sampling** : reduces dimensionality of each feature map, while retaining most important info

- **Classification (Fully Connected Layer)** : outputs from first 3 layers are high-level features of input image. fully connected layers uses the features to classify the input image into various classes based on training dataset


## Generative AI
- subset of DL 
- type of AI that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content
