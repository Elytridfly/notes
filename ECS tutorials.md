Q2 You are to design a battery charger using a microprocessor, so it will have more features than standard ones. The user needs to select a battery type which will control the time and amount of current used. When charging, an LED will indicate this. When fully charged, the LED will change colour to show this. The battery type selected is shown, together with the status of charging. 
a. Specify the goals and constraints

b) During the system analysis phase, why is it necessary to first identify the hardware subsystems? 


c) What is the purpose of conducting feasibility studies during systems analysis? How is this different from a prototype?
